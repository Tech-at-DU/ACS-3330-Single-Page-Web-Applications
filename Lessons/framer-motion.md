# üéûÔ∏è Animation with Framer Motion in React

## üìò Introduction

Framer Motion is a **powerful and popular animation library** for React. It provides simple, declarative APIs to animate elements based on state, component lifecycle, and user gestures. With built-in features like spring physics, layout transitions, and exit animations, Framer Motion lets you bring your React UI to life ‚Äî no extra CSS or JavaScript required.

This lesson introduces Framer Motion with practical examples for use in any React app, including Vite-based projects.

## üëÄ Get Inspired: Amazing Animation Examples

Before we dive into Framer Motion code, let's see what good animation looks like! Explore these real-world examples where motion enhances the user experience:

**üëÄ Goal:**
As you browse, look for:
- How elements move naturally (fade, slide, pop)
- How hover and tap interactions add responsiveness
- How animations feel subtle ‚Äî enhancing the design, not distracting

## ‚úÖ Why Use Framer Motion?

- Still widely used and actively maintained
- Easy to implement animations with `initial`, `animate`, and `exit`
- Built-in support for presence transitions, gestures, and layout-aware animations
- Works great with modern build tools like Vite and frameworks like Next.js or Remix

## ‚ö° Installation

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

Works immediately with Vite, CRA, and modern React setups.

## ‚ú® Basic Example: Fade In Card

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

function Card() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 2 }}
      className="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-md"
    >
      Hello with animation!
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

Framer Motion redefines all of the standard components like `div`, `p`, `h1`, etc. as `motion.div`, `motion.p`, `motion.h1` etc. These can be animated with props like: `initial`, `animate`, `exit` and more. 

### ‚úÖ Check Your Understanding
- What happens if you leave out `initial`?
- Can you animate multiple properties?

üí¨ **AI Prompt:** "How can I animate both opacity and scale at the same time?"

### How to apply this? 
You can use the idea above to animate all of the elements on a "page" or in a component. 

- import motion with: `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`
- Add `motion.` to the front each tag that will animate. For example: `<div>` becomes `<motion.div>`. 
- Set `initial` to set the starting properties of each element.
- Set `animate` to animate elements to their ending properties. 
- You can animate any CSS property. Use the JS (camel case) version of the property name. You can also use `x` and `y` which are not standard CSS property names. For example: 

```JS
<motion.h1
  initial={{ y: 10, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  className='text-5xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mb-3 ml-5'
>{Math.round(main.temp)}&deg;
</motion.h1>
```

Do this for each element. Adjust the propties to get the effect you are looking for. 

The `transition` attribute allows you to control the duration, delay, and more. Try this: 

```JS
<motion.p
  initial={{ y: 10, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ y: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ delay: 0.3 }}
  className='text-lg text-gray-600 capitalize mb-1'>
  {weather[0].description}
</motion.p>
```

This element will delay 0.3 secs before its animation begins. Use this to "sequence" or "choreograph" your motion! 

There are more properties than these Framer Motion is a robust tool with many options!

## üîÅ AnimatePresence
`AnimatePresence` handles elements that are added and removed from the DOM. Make it the parent of elements that will be dynamically rendered. 

```jsx
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion'

function Modal({ show }) {
  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      {show && (
        <motion.div
          key="modal"
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
          exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
          className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50"
        >
          Modal content
        </motion.div>
      )}
    </AnimatePresence>
  )
}
```

üß† **Why use a `key`?**
Framer Motion needs a unique `key` to properly track entering and exiting components. Without a key, exit animations won't run reliably.

### ‚úÖ Check Your Understanding
- Why do we need AnimatePresence?
- What happens without a key?

üí¨ **AI Prompt:** "Explain how AnimatePresence controls unmounting animations."

## ü§∏ Gesture-Based Animations

### üß† What Are Gestures?

Gestures are user interactions like hover, tap, drag, and focus. Framer Motion lets you animate based on these without adding event listeners manually.

### ‚úã Supported Gesture Types:

- `whileHover`
- `whileTap`
- `drag`
- `whileFocus`
- `whileInView`

```jsx
<motion.button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
  className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
>
  Click Me
</motion.button>
```

### ‚úÖ Check Your Understanding
- How would you animate color on hover?

üí¨ **AI Prompt:** "How can I animate background color transitions on hover?"

## üé® Advanced Example: Variants and Staggering

### üß† What Are Variants?

Variants allow you to define animation states separately from your component JSX, keeping code clean and modular.

### üß† What is Staggering?

Staggering means delaying child animations one after another for a cascading effect using `staggerChildren`.

```jsx
const listVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.2 }
  }
}

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
}

function AnimatedList({ items }) {
  return (
    <motion.ul 
      initial="hidden" 
      animate="visible" 
      variants={listVariants}
    >
      {items.map((item) => (
        <motion.li 
          key={item} 
          variants={itemVariants}
        >
          {item}
        </motion.li>
      ))}
    </motion.ul>
  )
}
```

‚úÖ Perfect for menus, lists, and galleries!
