# 🧪 Final Project – Build a Custom React App

## 📝 Overview
This is your opportunity to build a custom React project that demonstrates your creativity and technical skills using the tools and patterns you’ve learned in class.

You’ll apply key concepts from React and Redux Toolkit, such as controlled components, API integration, state management, and asynchronous data fetching. You'll also practice working responsibly with AI tools.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Reinforce knowledge of single-page applications built with React
- Demonstrate the ability to manage application state with Redux
- Fetch and render data from an external API
- Use form elements with the controlled component pattern
- Build and structure your app for maintainability
- Use AI tools thoughtfully and responsibly

---

## ✅ Project Requirements
Your custom project must:

- Be built with **React** as a single-page application
- Use **form elements** with the **controlled component pattern**
- Be structured with **modular components**
- Include error handling and basic UI states (loading, empty, etc.)
- Use **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** to manage application state
- Include at least one of the following: 
  - Integrate with at least **one external API** using `fetch` or `createAsyncThunk`
  - Use Tailwind
  - Implement UI animation with Framer Motion
  - Use React Query

---

## 🔐 Responsible Use of AI
You are encouraged to use AI tools to:
- Help you understand concepts and review your code
- Provide guidance or debugging suggestions

You should NOT:
- Use AI to generate your entire app without understanding the code
- Submit work you do not understand or cannot explain

📝 **Include a short section in your README** describing how you used AI. Example:
> “I used AI to get help writing a reducer function and to debug my fetch request to OpenWeatherMap.”
